        h3 🔗 What is Blockchain?
        p Blockchain is a revolutionary distributed ledger technology that creates an immutable, decentralized database. Each block contains data and is cryptographically linked to the previous block, forming an unbreakable chain of trust that cannot be altered without consensus from the network.

      .explanation-card
        h3 ⛏️ Proof-of-Work Mining
        p Mining is the process of finding a special number (nonce) that makes the block's hash start with a specific number of zeros. This "proof-of-work" ensures blocks are computationally expensive to create but easy to verify, preventing spam and maintaining network security.

        h3 🔐 Cryptographic Hashing
        p SHA256 hashing transforms any input data into a unique 64-character hexadecimal string. Even a tiny change in input produces a completely different hash. This property ensures data integrity and enables the chain's immutability.

      .explanation-card
        h3 📊 Block Structure
        p Each block contains: Block Number (index), Nonce (mining solution), Data (transactions), Previous Hash (link to prior block), and Current Hash (proof of work). The hash depends on all block contents, making tampering mathematically detectable.

      .explanation-card
        h3 🌐 Distributed Consensus
        p Multiple network participants maintain identical copies of the blockchain. New blocks are only accepted when validated by the majority, ensuring no single entity can control or corrupt the ledger.

      .explanation-card
        h3 💰 Cryptocurrency Applications
        p Beyond Bitcoin, blockchain enables smart contracts, decentralized finance (DeFi), non-fungible tokens (NFTs), supply chain tracking, and secure digital identity systems.
